# ♠️ GTOForge

**GTOForge** is a personal project that lays the foundation for a poker solver with plans to integrate AI/ML features for explainability, training, and game analysis. This project is a creative exploration into decision-making logic, game theory, and intelligent tooling for poker players.

## 📌 Features (In Progress)

- ✅ Basic hand evaluation using `treys`
- ✅ Preflop range representation and parsing
- 🔁 Game tree construction using `networkx`
- 🔁 Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) engine
- 🔁 Streamlit interface for interactive exploration
- 🧠 Planned: LLM-based natural language explanation of solver outputs
- 📊 Planned: Visualizations of ranges, EV flows, and player tendencies
